# Final-Assignment-CMPM121
Final Assignment Pitch:
•	A 3D mini Adventure game. This is a game that players need to save the oasis by refill the water. As soon as the game started, the oasis will start to drain. So, the player needs to control the character to get water from spring of life and refill the oasis. There are enemies that if the character enters their range of vision, they will attack him. There is a timer, and after the time reaches zero, the game proceeds to next level (or the game end).
•	Final product:
1.	A completed desert scene with several blocks
2.	An animated controllable character
3.	One kind of animated enemies
4.	The animated oasis and animated life of spring (where player can collect and drop items)
5.	Timer
6.	Health bar for the character and the oasis
7.	Three levels
8.	Title Screen (menu and ending) 
•	Assignment 7: I will use different 3D game objects (cube, cylinder, etc.) to represent these things for assignment 7.
1.	A stretch scene
2.	A controllable character
3.	one enemy with AI that if it detects the character with a certain range, it will track and attack the character.
4.	The oasis 
5.	Spring of life
•	Assignment 8: 
1.	Add a timer
2.	Add functions for picking up items (water) and dropping items to refill the oasis (restore the health bar of the oasis)
3.	Add UI elements (options such as pause, back, etc.)
4.	Add title screen (menu and ending)
•	Assignment 9:
1.	Replace 3D game objects with assets
2.	Add animations for the character and the enemy.
3.	Make 2 levels (one will be a tutorial level)
4.	Complete uncompleted tasks of assignment7&8 (if there are any previous tasks I didn’t complete).
•	Stretch goals:  
1.	Add running ability for the character
2.	Add an energy bar for the character. The character will not be able to move if he lose all of the energy (the character will lose energy when he is running, and he will restore his energy while he is not running).
3.	Add two more kinds of enemies with different detective ranges.
4.	Add one more level.
5.	Add animation for the oasis draining.
•	I will get assets from asset store.
